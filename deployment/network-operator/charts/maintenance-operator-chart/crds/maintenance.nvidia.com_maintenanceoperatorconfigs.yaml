                  MaxParallelOperations indicates the maximal number nodes that can undergo maintenance
                  at a given time. 0 means no limit
                  value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total nodes in the cluster (ex: 10%).
                  absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                  defaults to 1. The actual number of nodes that can undergo maintenance may be lower depending
                  on the value of MaintenanceOperatorConfigSpec.MaxUnavailable.

                  MaxUnavailable is the maximum number of nodes that can become unavailable in the cluster.

                  absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                  by default, unset.
                  new nodes will not be processed if the number of unavailable node will exceed this value
